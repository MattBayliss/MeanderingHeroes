A command is a goal, or animal's instinct. 
A Command will be assigned an [[Initiative]] score at the beginning of each turn. Highest is better,  they'll be processed lowest to highest. An Intent will trigger [[Events]] - and the ones that go first are more likely to [[Triggers|Trigger]] a [[Reactions|Reaction]]

Following [read advice](https://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html), try to make intents act on the smallest state possible?

```md
Move Command

Location => (Map, Destinaton, Speed) => Location 

```
