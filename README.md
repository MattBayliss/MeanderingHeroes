# Meandering Heroes

## Overview

Broadly, Meandering Heroes will be a Fantasy RTS, but a "game" can take months or years. MH will be a living, persistent multi-player world where a player is in control of a guild, and gives their members (Heroes) instructions and goals, and a rich A.I. will determine the success or failure of your Heroes. It will be designed for players to log in, read the reports of what has occurred since their last visit, and give new orders as required. Orders can take days or weeks real-time to resolve.

Well, that's the ultimate goal. It will start a bit less ambitious than that.

It is also a vechile to learn some more of the following technologies:

* Reactive extensions
* F# (for A.I. and queue processing)
* SAFE stack?

## Milestones

1. Design basic architecture and get a "move" action unit test to pass
2. Create Map to show progress of your Hero
